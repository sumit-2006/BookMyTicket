## Setup Instructions

> **Important:**  
> Before running the application, ensure that:
> - **Lombok** is installed in your IDE. Missing Lombok can cause compile-time errors, as it generates getters, setters, and constructors. For installation help, search for "Lombok installation in IntelliJ or Eclipse" on YouTube.
> - The project is imported as a **Maven** project.
> - Update **database credentials** (username, password, and URL) in the `application.properties` file to match your local setup.

> **Admin Access Setup**  
> - Start the application and navigate to `http://localhost:9999/TRSApp`.
> - Click the **Register New User** button to create a new account.
> - By default, new users are registered with the role `CUSTOMER`.  
> - To grant a user admin rights, go to the database and manually update the userâ€™s role to `ADMIN` in `users` table.
> - Make sure to check out the `develop` branch before running the project, as it contains the latest updates not yet merged into `main`.
